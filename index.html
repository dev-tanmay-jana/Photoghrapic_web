                    <h4>The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo,
                         meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image a 
                         photograph on lightsensitive film or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic
                          or magnetic memory.The camera is the image-forming device, and a photographic plate,
                           photographic film or a silicon electronic image sensor is the capture medium. The respective 
                           recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.
                            Photographers control the camera and lens to "expose" the light recording material to the 
                            required amount of light to form a "latent image" (on plate or film) or RAW file 
                            (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image.</h4>
